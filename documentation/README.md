A junior college student who currently has a low paying job and no free

errands, cleaning, etc. He often finds that he doesn’t have enough time to do all 
these things in a comfortable, timely manner and just wants to be able to cook for 
himself without always having to waste more and more money on groceries and 
constantly look for different recipes to try. He just wants a simple way to find 
new recipes to try.
