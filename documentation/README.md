## Wendy - 
A gourmet chef who is looking for recipes to serve at her restaurant. 
She only has the budget for certain ingredients for her restaurant but still
wants to create and serve high quality food. She wants to be mindful of customers 
that may have certain food allergies and thus wants to be inclusive to all. She 
would utilize Recipe Rendezvous in order to create new, unique meals that offer 
variety across her menu. She can go and do her research with prospective ingredients
at home before ordering in bulk and testing out different generated recipes.

## Bob - 
A junior college student who currently has a low paying job and no free 
time due to always attending classes and studying hard. He has to take care of 
himself and so he needs to balance his time cooking meals, doing laundry, running 
errands, cleaning, etc. He often finds that he doesn’t have enough time to do all 
these things in a comfortable, timely manner and just wants to be able to cook for 
himself without always having to waste more and more money on groceries and 
constantly look for different recipes to try. He just wants a simple way to find 
new recipes to try with minimal grocery shopping necessary. 

## Dorothy Morris - 
A single mother of two who is limited by a low budget. 
She was never formally taught how to cook so she doesn’t feel confident about
where to start and feels that her current cooking habits could be improved. She 
is always struggling to figure out how to integrate healthier ingredients into 
her children’s diets as they are picky eaters as well. → After discovering this 
app, she was able to be more creative with her dishes and learned a lot of new 
cooking tips. She enjoys how easy it is to document her ingredients and tailor 
recipes to her needs.
