## Overview
Our project Recipe Rendezvous aims to allow users to receive random recipes based upon the desired meal that they select. Users are asked for which meal they want to generate a recipe for from breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert. This project will take data from a database in order to generate these recipes for the user. This project will serve a diverse range of users including professionals, those with culinary interest, money-conscious individuals, or anyone who is looking for creative, new recipes. This application differs from other applications because it gives recipes to users based on meal preference, in which other applications may just give generic suggestions for recipes. This application saves users time and caters towards the user. Furthermore, the inspiration for this project was our passion for cooking and looking for new recipes.

## Goals
- To attend to the needs of users who want to create fun, new recipes they have not seen before
- Cater to userâ€™s meal preferences 
- Create a user friendly app to allow cooking lovers to cook with varying recipes

## Areas of Focus
<em>Primary Area of Focus: </em>


The primary area of focus of our project is Area 1: HTML, CSS, and graphics for  page layout and design. This app is expected to be a very user friendly app so that it is easy and fun to use for people regardless of their needs and draws in users by making it look pleasant to the eyes with a comprehensive color palatte, with easily accessible and clear buttons. 

<em>Secondary Area of Focus: </em>


The secondary area of focus for our project will be Area 3: Pull static data from a JSON data file. We created four separate JSON files to store our pre-selected recipes for each meal. These recipes were parsed using jQuery to display a randomly pulled recipe from the list of recipes. We also pulled data from a JSON file to display information for each developer on the home page using AJAX and jQuery.

## Recap

<em>Proposal: </em>
Our project aims to allow users to receive random recipes based on a selected meal: breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert. This project will take static data from a JSON files to generate these recipes for the user. This project will serve a diverse range of users including professionals, those with culinary interest, or anyone who is looking for creative, new recipes. This application differs from other applications because in which other applications may give recipes in general, not based on meal preference. This application saves users time and caters towards the user. Furthermore, the inspiration for this project was our passion for cooking and looking for new recipes.

<em>Final Project Plan: </em>
We ended up pulling static data from JSON files to generate our recipes for our website as well as using JSON to pull data on each person for our about me section on the index page. Some javascript and JQuery were used to pull this data and display it on the website. We updated the project details as we worked on it and came up with the final plan of creating a random recipe generator that generates recipes based on the selection of a meal: breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert. We updated our mockup, personas, and IA accordingly. 

<em>Results and Conclusion: </em>
Our final project was successful and generates a random number of random recipes for users to select from based on a selected meal. Though our project is successful and completed our goals, we have many future plans to look forward to. We want to introduce dietary preference (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and keto-friendly), incorporate ingredient filtering and substitution, include personalization and community engagement (user accounts for personalized recipe recommendations, social sharing features, and community forums), and ensure everything is compatible across different devices and browsers. Additionally, we learned many important skills such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and time-management/organization. These skills all led to a successfully completed project and a well-connected team. We are excited for the future impacts of our website!
